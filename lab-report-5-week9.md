# Lab Report 5 (Week 9)
## Part 1
For part 1, I'll be covering a debugging scenario in the format of an EdStem post conversation between a student and a TA.

Throughout the scenario, I'll be providing the following information:
* The file & directory structure needed
* The contents of each file before fixing the bug
* The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
* A description of what to edit to fix the bug

I'll also be using the materials from [Lab 6](https://ucsd-cse15l-f23.github.io/week/week6/). The Java file I'll be using is from [Lab 6 Student Submission](https://ucsd-cse15l-f23.github.io/week/week6/#student-submissions), specifically the [corrected version](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected) (so that the bug shown is actually from the student's error rather that the submissions). As for the bash script, I'll be using my version of `grade.sh` that I built for the lab task from the provided [repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/list-examples-grader) in Lab 6.

#### Student:
Hello, I seem to be having trouble in getting `TestListExamples.java` to run. Here's the symptom that I'm getting after running `bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected` in the command line:
