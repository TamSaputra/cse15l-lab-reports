# Lab Report 1 (Week 1)  
For this week's lab report, I'll be going over 3 commands we learned in week 1 lectures which are: ```cd```, ```ls```, and ```cat```.  

And for each of the commands, I'll be showing an example of:  
* Using the command with *no* argument
* Using the command with a path to a *directory* as an argument
* Using the command with a path to a *file* as an argument

For the examples, I'll be using the file structure that was cloned from [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f23/lecture1](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f23/lecture1) into the EdStem workspace where all of the example screenshots will be taken from.  

## Commands
1. ```cd```
![cdNoArgs](https://github.com/TamSaputra/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/112127930/b7531845-a632-4a3c-be9c-da86be0b667e)
  * Working directory: ```/home/lecture1```
  * ```cd``` stands for "change directory". Since there is no argument, the working directory doesn't move and goes back to the parent directory.
  * Using the command with no argument doesn't throw out an error.
