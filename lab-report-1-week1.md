# Lab Report 1 (Week 1)  
For this week's lab report, I'll be going over 3 commands we learned in week 1 lectures which are: ```cd```, ```ls```, and ```cat```.  

And for each of the commands, I'll be showing an example of:  
* Using the command with *no* argument
* Using the command with a path to a *directory* as an argument
* using the command with a path to a *file* as an argument
